# Reciprocating Compressor Kinematics

This GitHub repository stores source and test code for reciprocating compressor kinematic analytics.

The sections below provide descriptions of Mathematica worksheets, MATLAB scripts, and Jupyter notebooks. In addition, the repository includes examples of how the libraries can be used.

This worksheet derives the governing equations of motions for the piston (slider) displacement.

# Background

The software references terms and nomenclature related to reciprocating machinery. Specifically, the software code primarily addresses API-618 reciprocating compressors. These compressors have many subassemblies and moving parts. This section explains those subassemblies and provides definitions for some commonly encountered parts.

## Frame

The frame includes all static parts of the machine, such as supports, cylinders, heads, distance pieces, crosshead guides, crankcase, bolting, and the foundation (shown in the figure below). These components work together to transfer power from the crankshaft to the compressed gas.
